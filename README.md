# My Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome! This repository documents my journey as I learn web development from the ground up. It serves as a collection of all the projects, tasks, and exercises I complete, starting with the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced topics.

### 🎯 Current Focus: CSS

I am currently deep-diving into **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**. My main goal is to master styling, layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid, and creating responsive designs that work across all devices. The projects in the `CSS` folder reflect this stage of my learning.

🌐 How to View My Work
Each task folder (e.g., 01-Selectors-and-Properties) is a self-contained mini-project.

1. View Locally:
Clone this repository to your computer.
Navigate into any task folder (e.g., CSS/01-Selectors-and-Properties).
